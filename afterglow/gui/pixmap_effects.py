"""
Shared pixmap helpers for border rendering (sidebar nav buttons AND the
unedited-video-clip highlight): loading a user-chosen custom image in
place of the built-in gradient, and applying a hue shift to whichever
pixmap ends up being used.

Both are meant to be called ONCE per widget construction / settings
reload, never per-frame or from inside a paintEvent -- hue_shift_pixmap
in particular loops pixel-by-pixel in pure Python (no numpy dependency
is currently declared for this project's flake, so this deliberately
doesn't reach for it), which is a fine one-time cost (roughly half a
second on a 512x512 image, measured directly) but would be a real
per-frame performance problem if it were ever called from paintEvent.

    rectangle) in `color`, `width` pixels thick -- the "Filter Outline"
    setting, which was specifically asked to match the icon's actual
    shape rather than draw a square around it. Also fills any fully
    ENCLOSED transparent regions (a hole inside the silhouette, like
    the counter of a letter "O" or "A") with the outline color too, per
    a direct follow-up request -- a hollow gap poking through the
    middle of an otherwise-solid outline reads as a rendering glitch,
    not a design choice.

    The canvas GROWS outward by `width` on each side rather than the
    icon being shrunk inward to leave room within a fixed-size canvas
    (an earlier version did that). Shrinking the icon visually
    detaches the outline from where the icon's TRUE edge actually is --
    reported directly as the outline appearing to "float 1 or 2 pixels
    off" the icon. Growing outward instead means the icon is placed at
    its own full, untouched size, and the outline hugs its real edge
    by construction; the result is simply LARGER than the input now,
    and it's the CALLER's job to scale the whole composite (icon +
    outline together, so their relative proportions never change) down
    to whatever final display size is needed -- `_FilterIconLabel`
    already does exactly that scaling step regardless of this
    pixmap's own size, so this needs no caller-side change beyond
    what's already there.

    Implemented as a plain morphological dilation of the alpha channel
    (a pixel becomes part of the outline if it's currently transparent
    but within `width` pixels of an opaque one), plus a flood fill from
    the canvas border to distinguish true exterior transparent pixels
    from enclosed ones -- pure Python, no numpy, so this is a real
    O(w*h*width^2) cost. Fine for typical small icon sizes as a cached
    one-time-per-(icon, color, width) operation (see the cache below),

"""
The search field, redesigned per Max's direct correction: not a text
box that opens to the SIDE of the Search button (the old
_toggle_search_visibility placeholder), but a small popup that appears
UNDERNEATH the button and visually attaches to it with a little tail,
like a comic speech bubble. Outline color is the button/accent color;
fill color is the video card background color.

Revised again this round, per three more direct corrections:
1. The outline used to visibly "continue through" the tail as if the
   tail and body had two separate outlines, rather than reading as one
   continuous bubble outline -- caused by the tail's flat base sitting
   exactly COINCIDENT with the body's top edge (touching, not
   overlapping). QPainterPath.united()'s boolean-op result can leave a
   stray seam exactly where two shapes only touch at a shared edge
   rather than genuinely overlapping, since that edge doesn't fully
   resolve into either shape's interior. Fixed by extending the tail's
   base _TAIL_OVERLAP px past the body's top edge, into the body's own
   interior -- the seam then sits fully inside the united region and
   never becomes part of the outline Qt actually strokes.
2. The tail is now a curved, rounded shape (built from two cubic
   Beziers rather than three straight polygon edges) and wider at its
   base (_TAIL_WIDTH), so it reads as flowing into the bubble rather
   than a sharp triangular point stuck on top of it.
3. The bubble now centers itself directly under the anchor button
   (not left-aligned to it, which put a wide bubble mostly to one
   side) -- the tail sits at the bubble's horizontal center, which is
   therefore always aligned under the button too.

Qt.Popup gives the auto-close-on-outside-click behavior for free (a
mouse press anywhere outside the popup's geometry closes it) -- no
separate "click elsewhere" handling needed.
